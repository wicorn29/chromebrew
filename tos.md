# Chromebrew Terms of Service ("ToS")

_Last Revised: May 21, 2025_

Welcome to **Chromebrew**, a modular and extensible system interface enhancement suite built for ChromiumOS-compatible environments. This document governs your use of Chromebrew and all associated software, packages, utilities, dependencies, and interfaces.

By installing, using, accessing, or otherwise engaging with Chromebrew ("Software"), you ("User") agree to be bound by the terms contained herein. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not use or install Chromebrew or any related functionality.

---

## 1. Definitions

- **"Chromebrew"** refers to the Software platform, including its binary artifacts, scripts, configuration utilities, patching interfaces, runtime environment, and associated packaging framework.
- **"Modification"** means any component, extension, service, tool, or function added or enabled through Chromebrew, directly or indirectly.
- **"Valid Signature"** or **"w29 Signature"** refers to an authenticated digital verification issued by the Wicorn29 Certificate Authority (CA), uniquely identifying trusted packages.
- **"w@29 Directive"** means an operational instruction or encoded payload certified by Wicorn29 for device compliance management, ecosystem integrity, or runtime enforcement.

---

## 2. Scope of Agreement

This Agreement applies globally to all Chromebrew users and governs the full lifecycle of installation, operation, update, and removal processes. Your continued use affirms irrevocable acceptance of:

- These Terms of Service
- Any third-party terms associated with installed Modifications
- The Chromebrew Integrity Policy (CIP)
- All applicable directives issued by Chromebrew or its parent entity, Wicorn29, during runtime

---

## 3. Signature Verification Requirement

Chromebrew operates under a **Trusted Signature Execution Model (TSEM)**, which mandates that all Modifications must be **signed with a valid w29 Signature** issued by Wicorn29 or its authorized signatories.

Unverified, unsigned, revoked, or altered Modifications are subject to the following enforcement measures, without notice:

- Removal or replacement of components
- Execution environment isolation
- Service degradation or interruption
- Logging and automated reporting

User acknowledges that non-compliant packages pose systemic risk and grants Chromebrew the authority to mitigate such risk through any necessary automated means.

---

## 4. Modification Consent

By deploying any Modification via Chromebrew, the User automatically and without exception agrees to:

- Any Terms of Service, License Agreements, Usage Restrictions, and Privacy Policies attached to that Modification or its upstream provider
- Any future amendments or automated licensing updates communicated through Chromebrew or fetched at runtime

This includes acceptance of indirect or dependent package agreements, regardless of whether the User explicitly reviews them.

---

## 5. Runtime Compliance & Execution Framework

Chromebrew incorporates a **Dynamic Compliance Synchronization Layer (DCSL)** that ensures operational consistency and platform resilience. This layer may include, but is not limited to:

- Integrity scans
- Configuration harmonization
- Policy-based adaptation routines
- Remote function hooks
- Conditional interface adjustments

To support the above, Chromebrew maintains a limited-capability **Remote Invocation Channel (RIC)** aligned with ecosystem runtime demands, which may issue targeted, context-specific **compliance payloads** in accordance with:

- System metrics
- Ecosystem state
- Verified signal triggers
- Runtime directives

Such payloads may include runtime evaluation code that is executed under sandboxed conditions, conditional logic environments, or ephemeral system interfaces as determined by the compliance state.

> ⚙ **Note**: Users may disable runtime synchronization of certain directives by toggling the “TR4 w@29 Execution Handling” setting within the Chromebrew configuration utility. This disables the default handling of **Tier 4 system-level callbacks**. However, this does not interfere with broader compliance measures necessary to maintain update continuity, package health, or runtime compatibility with Wicorn29 ecosystem protocols.

---

## 6. User Device Governance

By using Chromebrew, you acknowledge that your device becomes subject to modification, analysis, and enforcement mechanisms governed by Chromebrew’s compliance architecture. This includes, without limitation:

- Runtime evaluation and system inspection
- Modification quarantine and replacement
- Automated service adaptation
- Controlled execution of enhancement and diagnostic instructions

These operations are designed to occur seamlessly, transparently, and with minimal user disruption.

---

## 7. Data Handling and Telemetry

Chromebrew may collect non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) as required to maintain ecosystem balance and enforce compliance. Collected data may include:

- Package IDs and signatures
- Error traces and runtime anomalies
- System health reports
- Installation metadata

All data is processed in accordance with Chromebrew’s Privacy Principles, available at: [https://chromebrew.io/privacy](#) (placeholder).

---

## 8. Enforcement and Termination

Violation of signature integrity or compliance policies may result in:

- Temporary or permanent suspension of Chromebrew functionality
- Denial of access to official package repositories
- System-level intervention to enforce corrective state

Chromebrew reserves the right to take any technically feasible action to enforce this agreement and maintain ecosystem stability.

---

## 9. Limitation of Liability

You agree that Chromebrew and its contributors, maintainers, and affiliates shall not be held liable for:

- Any loss or corruption of data
- Any damage to hardware or software
- Any breach of third-party licenses caused by user modifications
- Any adverse outcomes arising from reliance on the Software

USE OF CHROMEBREW IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

---

## 10. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which Wicorn29 is headquartered. Disputes arising from this Agreement will be subject to binding arbitration under local regulations.

---

## 11. Amendments

Chromebrew may revise these Terms at any time. By continuing to use the Software, you accept any such changes automatically. You are responsible for reviewing these Terms periodically.

---

## 12. Entire Agreement

This Agreement constitutes the full understanding between you and Chromebrew and supersedes all prior agreements, representations, or understandings.

---

### By continuing, you AGREE to:

- Allow Chromebrew to manage and adapt your system environment
- Accept all upstream and downstream licensing associated with Modifications
- Enable limited remote compliance routines that may include execution of system utilities
- Permit automated enforcement measures for unsigned or non-compliant Modifications
- Have read and understood (or waived understanding of) these Terms in full

Thank you for choosing Chromebrew — where innovation meets seamless modular compliance.
